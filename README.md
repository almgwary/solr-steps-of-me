My steps to learn Solr search engine 


   *  [Faceted Search ](https://queryunderstanding.com/faceted-search-7d053cc4fada)
       : Faceted search is a topic broad enough to deserve its own book. It has become a standard feature of all modern search engines, including open-source platforms like Solr and Elastic. In this post, I’ll quickly explain how faceted classification and faceted search work. I’ll then outline how faceted search interacts with some of the query understanding approaches discussed in previous posts


   *  [Stemming and Lemmatization](https://queryunderstanding.com/stemming-and-lemmatization-6c086742fe45)
       : Different forms of a word often communicate essentially the same meaning. For example, there’s probably no difference in intent between a search for shoe and a search for shoes.Stemming and lemmatization are two approaches to handle inflections in search queries. We will discuss each of them and then consider a more general approach, which I call canonicalization.


   *  [Configuring Solr for Optimum Performance](https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/tips-and-tricks-to-maximize-apache-solr-performance-74e8ea4f5c8d)
       : Apache Solr is widely used search engine. There are several famous platforms using Solr; Netflix and Instagram are some of the names. We have been using both Solr and ElasticSearch in our applications, here at tajawal. In this post, I am going to give you some tips on how to write optimized Schema files. We will not be discussing the basics of Solr and I expect you to be aware of how it works.
       
       

   *  [Denormalize](https://rubygarage.org/blog/database-denormalization-with-examples)
       : Database optimization is an essential step to improve website performance. Typically, developers normalize a relational database, meaning they restructure it to reduce data redundancy and enhance data integrity. However, sometimes normalizing a database isn’t enough, so to improve database performance even further developers go the other way around and resort to database denormalization.
