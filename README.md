My steps to learn Solr search engine 


   *  [Faceted Search ](https://queryunderstanding.com/faceted-search-7d053cc4fada)
       : Faceted search is a topic broad enough to deserve its own book. It has become a standard feature of all modern search engines, including open-source platforms like Solr and Elastic. In this post, I’ll quickly explain how faceted classification and faceted search work. I’ll then outline how faceted search interacts with some of the query understanding approaches discussed in previous posts


   *  [Stemming and Lemmatization](https://queryunderstanding.com/stemming-and-lemmatization-6c086742fe45)
       : Different forms of a word often communicate essentially the same meaning. For example, there’s probably no difference in intent between a search for shoe and a search for shoes.Stemming and lemmatization are two approaches to handle inflections in search queries. We will discuss each of them and then consider a more general approach, which I call canonicalization.
